# unison deployment

this is intended to set up unison directories and the necessary cron jobs to
integrate it with s3

## manual steps

the `.s3cfg` that must be in `unison` users homedir is not automatically
generated because i cannot be bothered.

the ssh keys are stored on the server in unison's homedir and in the other
location i store my keys.
